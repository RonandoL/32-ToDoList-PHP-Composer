User inputs text into form which instantiates new task and displays all tasks on return to home page.

## Running the tests

Push de button.

### Break down into end to end tests

* Before we display any tasks, we start with an empty $output string.
* Then we call the static method Task::getAll();
* If it returns an empty array, there are no tasks to display yet.
* If it is not empty, then there are tasks to display,
* so inside of our IF statement we loop through the tasks and display the description for each task by adding it to the $output string.
* We can create and save objects by submitting a post request from the form.
